### Install
```
go get github.com/blbergwall/assert
```

### Overview
Provide a collection of assert and testing helper methods

When an assert fails t.Fatal is called ending the current test with failure

### Usage

```
func TestATest(t *testing.T) {
	a := assert.New(t)

	result, err := methodUnderTest()
	a.NoError(err)
	a.Equal(5, result)
}
```

### Why?
Mainly because this package is used by another package I plan to provide.

I am aware of [stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) and
maybe I should switch to using that.

Also I am fairly new to go and publishing open source code and want to learn
more about both.
